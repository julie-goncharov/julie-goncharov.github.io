title: SALT 30 - Dynamic presupposition of 'want'
description: "In this talk, we argue that desire predicates like 'want' have a dynamic presupposition derived using belief revisions. The argument comes from polarity sensitivity phenomena."

Heim (1992) proposes that sentences with _want_ have the presupposition in (1a). Romoli (2012) argues that (1a) is incompatible with recent accounts of strong NPI licensing, which substitute Anti-Additivity with the requirement that strong NPIs are felicitous when in addition to the assertive content, scalar implicatures and presuppositions are also Downward Entailing (DE) (Gajewski 2011, Chierchia 2013). Romoli (2012) proposes a weaker presupposition in (1b).


(1a) 'x wants p' only defined iff: p and not-p are epistemically possible for x

(1b) â€˜x wants p' only defined iff: if x considers p epistemically possible, then x considers not-p epistemically possible
``

We show that both (1a) and (1b) are inadequate for accounting for the distribution of strong NPIs, as well as PPIs, under _not want_ in accidental contexts. We propose a new dynamic presupposition for _want_ derived using belief update semantics.

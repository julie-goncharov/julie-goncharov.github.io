Negative Inversion (NI), as in (1a), and its embedded version where subject-auxiliary inversion is licensed not by a negative quantifier in Spec,CP, but rather by an NPI in Spec,CP that in turn is licensed by a negated Neg-raising predicate (the so-called Horn-clauses, Horn 1972), as in (1b), have never received a semantic explanation. The most prominent syntactic account of (1) by Collins and Postal 2014 has been heavily criticized by Horn 2014; Zeijlstra 2017, a.o.

(1a) Nowhere did he mention my book (NI)

(1b) I donâ€™t think that anywhere did he mention my book (Horn-clause)

We put forward the first (to our knowledge) semantic-pragmatic account of NI and Horn-clauses, which (i) explains their distribution, (ii) is compatible with a semantic-pragmatic approach to Neg-raising, and (iii) is immune to the criticisms raised against Collins and Postal 2014.

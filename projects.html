                             Artificial intelligence is everywhere. From its use in medical diagnosis to relationship chatbots, AI technology is improving rapidly in the diverse tasks it can perform, offering genuine benefits to human social life along with novel risks. With so much at stake, AI designers and users would be wise to have a sober conversation about what AI systems are, and how they can be effectively and ethically employed. In addition to a technical understanding of AI systems, such a conversation also requires an exploration of certain AI systems as unique agents that encode, or can be interpreted as encoding, intentional actions in communication with humans. In particular, large language models (LLMs) are often used by humans in unique forms of request-making, collaboration, and problem solving. As a result, humans find themselves working with and alongside LLM systems when carrying out a range of tasks in research, industry, art, and more. It is the goal of this proposed conference, "Agency and Intentions in Artificial Intelligence," to promote a much-needed interdisciplinary conversation surrounding the unique ways that AI systems might be thought of as agents that embody intentional actions.

                             </div>
                             Over the last thirty years, linguists have observed that various grammatical phenomena are sensitive to the interpretation of an action as intentional versus non-intentional. Henceforth, we refer to this effect as action sensitivity. Action sensitivity phenomena come from different domains of the grammar and affect unrelated languages. Although the effect shows clear signs of a universal constraint, there has been no systematic empirical or theoretical investigation of it. Understanding linguistic mechanisms underlying action sensitivity is the main goal of this project. The outcomes of the project will be relevant not only for theoretical linguistics, but also for other cognitive disciplines, most notably experimental philosophy, as well as developmental and clinical psychology.                         </td>

                             AIL is a series of annual interdisciplinary workshops on Agency and Intentions in Language. The goal of these workshops is to bring together scholars in linguistics, philosophy, psychology, and other disciplines who are interested in questions related to agency, intentions, reasoning about actions, and causation, broadly construed.

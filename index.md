I am interested in language as an activity that reveals human reasoning.
I take the perspective that grammatical restrictions come from two sources: purely linguistic conditions imposed by the structure of language and pragmatic conditions arising from general (non-linguistic) reasoning.
In current linguistic theories, these two types of conditions are often confused, resulting in inadequate analyses and explanatory dead ends.

To separate purely linguistic conditions from general reasoning, I examine grammatical phenomena with atypical pragmatic conditions (such as emphatic uses of degree modifiers and exceptional polarity licensing).
I am especially interested in linguistic phenomena sensitive to the distinction between intentional and non-intentional actions (such as the prohibition on coreferential subjects or perfective aspect with intentional actions, or the unacceptability of words like 'a damn thing' with non-intentional actions).
These phenomena make a clear separation between purely linguistic  conditions and general reasoning.
My work shows the need to redefine the role of pragmatics in the overall architecture of grammar.

## About me

I received my doctoral degree in theoretical linguistics from  the University of Toronto in 2015.
Since then, I have worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Georg-August University of Göttingen, and University of Tromsø.
I am currently a post-doctoral fellow in a DFG-funded project <a  target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://uni-goettingen.de/de/vorschau_3dd0fb16351b3f7ffbd9a226d14b3a9b/652812.html">Action Sensitivity in Grammar</a> at the Georg-August University in Göttingen.

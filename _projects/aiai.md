AIAI is a conference to be held on May 15-17, 2024 at the University of GoÌˆttingen. Its goal is to engage an interdisciplinary community of scholars who are interested in AI in a sober theoretical conversation about what AI systems are, and how they can be effectively and ethically employed. In addition to a technical understanding of AI systems, such a conversation also requires an exploration of certain AI systems as unique agents that encode, or can be interpreted as encoding, intentional actions in communication with humans. In particular, large language models (LLMs) are often used by humans in unique forms of request-making, collaboration, and problem solving. As a result, humans find themselves working with and alongside LLM systems when carrying out a range of tasks in research, industry, art, and more. It is the goal of this proposed conference, "Agency and Intentions in Artificial Intelligence," to promote a much-needed interdisciplinary conversation surrounding the unique ways that AI systems might be thought of as agents that embody intentional actions.

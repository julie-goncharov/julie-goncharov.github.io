ASG is a DFG-funded project at the University of GoÌˆttingen (PIs: Thomas Weskott, Hedde Zeijlstra). Its goal is to unify and experimenatlly test a number of grammatical phenomena that are sensitive to the interpretation of an action as intentional versus non-intentional.. The action sensitivity phenomena come from different domains of the grammar and affect unrelated languages. Although the effect shows clear signs of a universal constraint, there has been no systematic empirical or theoretical investigation of it. Understanding linguistic mechanisms underlying action sensitivity is the main goal of this project. The outcomes of the project will be relevant not only for theoretical linguistics, but also for other cognitive disciplines, most notably experimental philosophy, as well as developmental and clinical psychology.

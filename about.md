I received my degree in theoretical linguistics from  [University of Toronto](https://www.linguistics.utoronto.ca/) in 2015. Since then I have worked as a post-doctoral researcher at [Hebrew University of Jerusalem](https://scholars.huji.ac.il/llcc/home), [Georg-August University of Göttingen](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/119637.html), and [University of Tromsø](https://uit.no/enhet/isk). My main areas of expertise are semantics and pragmatics of natural languages. My recent research focuses on how our intentions are manifested in language. You can read more about this exciting topic [here](/i^2/index.html).

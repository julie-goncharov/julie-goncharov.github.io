I received my degree in theoretical linguistics from the [University of Toronto](https://www.linguistics.utoronto.ca/) in 2015. Since then I have worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the [Language, Logic and Congnition Center](https://scholars.huji.ac.il/llcc/home) at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, [English Department](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/119637.html) at Georg-August University of Göttingen, and [Department of Language and Culture](https://uit.no/enhet/isk) at University of Tromsø. My main areas of expertise are semantics and pragmatics of natural languages. My recent research focuses on how our intentions are manifested in language. You can read more about this exciting topic [here](/i^2).

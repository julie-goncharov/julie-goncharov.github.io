I have received my degree in theoretical linguistics from the University of Toronto in 2015. Since then I have worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the Language, Logic and Congnition Center at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, University of Goettingen, and University of Troms√∏. My recent reserach and great interest focuses on how our intentions are manifested in language. You can read more about this topic here.
